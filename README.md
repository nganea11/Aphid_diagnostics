# Aphid_diagnostics

Here, we attempt to use various approaches to identify aphid species from Next generation sequencing (NGS) data. This is a continuation and deviation from the reliance on DNA barcoding and minibarcodes for species identification as demostrated in by [Batovska et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85855-), amongst others.
