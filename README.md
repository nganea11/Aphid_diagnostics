# Aphid_diagnostics

Here, we attempt to use various approaches to identify aphid species from Next generation sequencing (NGS) data. This is a continuation and deviation from the reliance on DNA barcoding and targeted meta-barcoding for species identification as demostrated in by [Batovska et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85855-6), amongst others. These approaches highly relies on the success of DNA extraction and more importantly, the amplification of barcoding region via PCR. While PCR is quick and robust, performing diagnosis this way may lead to negligence of other diversity that exists outside the barcodes, which may be a novel or new species. Here, we rely on sequencing and analysis of whole genome and and organellar genomes for analysis and subsequent identification of aphids.
